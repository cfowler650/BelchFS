# Belch Back End Code

Belch is a web app inspired by yelp that serves as a solution for the paradox of choice at a restaurant. Users are encouraged to take a picture of, rate, and review their meal after they are finished eating. This user generated data then serves to help future patrons find the best dish to order on the menu, without the head ache or the possibility of ordering a sub-par meal, saving them wasted money and precious time. (Javascript, React, CSS, HTML, PostgreSQL, Ruby on Rails, Node).
